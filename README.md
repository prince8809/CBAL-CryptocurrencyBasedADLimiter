This website provides the best user experience with attractive user interface and relavant web content. Bootstrap along with core css makes it mobile compatible. It has a well planned information structure. You will find that all the pages have a common navbar which is built using bootstrap using the class- " navbar navbar-fixed-top navbar-inverse ". The best part about the navigation bar is that it opens up to a different page every time the user clicks on the options he sees on the navigation bar placed on the top of the page. All the pages are really attractive.
